# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into
# versioned archives to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer.
# They're included as a dependency of application charts to inject those
# utilities and functions into the rendering pipeline. Library charts
# do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time
# you make changes to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version
# number should be incremented each time you make changes to the application.

# the version the application is using. It is recommended to use it with quotes.
